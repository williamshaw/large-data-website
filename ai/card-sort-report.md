## Observations

- Did the participants have any common comments?
	- The most common comment that I got was if I had topic pre made topics I left it kind of open and purposely didn't give too much explaination. That way the card sorters can come to their own conclusions.
- Did they have questions that stood out?
	- They didn't really have any questions other then the comment listed above.
- Did they struggle with certain articles or topics?
	- Cats and Play was a subject that they struggled with it. I may need to be a bit more clear that the article is mostly dealing with how cats play.
- Did they find common groupings? Or were the groupings completely different?
	- The most common grouping was types of cats other then that they were completely different.
- Were some of the groupings completely unexpected?
	- LOL cats was a pretty fun and playful title. Im not sure if I will be able to use it though because it is not really that descriptive.
- Were the results similar to your expectations?
	- They were actually pretty similar
- How did you feel while watching them perform the task?
	- Nervous I had a certain way that I thought it should work out so its tough to see what other people would think.
