        <p>The health of domestic cats is a well studied area in veterinary medicine. Topics covered include infectious and genetic diseases, diet and nutrition and non-therapeutic surgical procedures such as neutering and declawing.</p>

        <h3>Infectious disease</h3>
        <p>An infectious disease is caused by the presence of organisms such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites (either animalian or protozoan). Most of these diseases can spread from cat to cat via airborne pathogens or through direct or indirect contact, while others require a vector such as a tick or mosquito. Certain infectious diseases are a concern from a public health standpoint because they are zoonoses (transmittable to humans).</p>

        <h4>Viral</h4>
        <p>Viral diseases in cats can be serious, especially in catteries and kennels. Timely vaccination can reduce the risk and severity of an infection. The most commonly recommended viruses to vaccinate cats against are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) is an upper respiratory infection of cats caused by feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1).</li>
          <li>Feline calicivirus (FCV), the other common viral cause of respiratory infection in cats.</li>
          <li>Feline panleukopenia (FPV) more commonly known as feline distemper.</li>
          <li>Rabies, a fatal disease transmitted by the bite of an infected mammal. In the United States, cats make up 4.6% of reported cases of rabies infected animals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Fungal</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Ringworm</li>
          <li>Cryptococcus</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Parasites</h4>
        <p>Veterinary parasitology studies both external and internal parasites in animals. External parasites, such as fleas, mites, ticks and mosquitoes can cause skin irritation and are often carriers of other diseases or of internal parasites.</p>

        <h4>Parasite medication</h4>
        <p>Once-a-month topical products or ingestible pills are the most commonly used products to kill and prevent future parasite infestations.</p>

        <h5>External Parasites</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Ear mites and other mites can cause skin problems such as mange.</li>
          <li>Ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes often carry multiple blood-borne diseases.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Internal Parasites</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Heartworm</li>

          <li>Toxoplasmosis</li>

        <h4>Genetic Disease</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Familial renal disease is inherited in Abyssinians and Persians</li>

          <li>Heart valve dysplasia</li>
          <li>Heterochromia</li>
          <li>Luxating patella</li>
          <li>Portosystemic shunt. Found in Persians and Himalayans.</li>

        <h3>Preventative medicine</h3>
        <h4>Vaccinations</h4>
        <p>Vaccinations are an important preventative animal health measure. The specific vaccinations recommended for cats varies depending on geographic location, environment, travel history, and the activities the animal frequently engages in. In the United States, regardless of any of these factors, it is usually highly recommended that cats be vaccinated against rabies, feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV), and feline panleukopenia virus (FPV). The decision on whether to vaccinate against other diseases should be made between an owner and a veterinarian, taking into account factors specific to the cat.</p>
        <h4>Detection of Diseases</h4>
        <p>Feline diseases such as FeLV, FIV, and feline heartworm can be detected during a routine visit to a veterinarian. A variety of tests exist that can detect feline illnesses, and with early detection most diseases can be managed effectively.</p>

        <h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
        <p>Veterinarians commonly recommend commercial cat foods that are formulated to address the specific nutritional requirements of cats although an increasing number of owners are opting for home-prepared cooked or raw diets. Although cats are obligate carnivores, vegetarian and vegan cat food are preferred by owners uncomfortable with feeding animal products to their pets. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Veterinary Medicine has come out against vegetarian cat and dog food for health reasons. Cats require high levels of Taurine in their diet. Taurine is an organic acid found in animal tissues. It is a major constituent of bile and can be found in the large intestine. Taurine has many biological roles such as conjugation of bile acids, antioxidation,membrane stabilization and modulation of calcium signaling. It is essential for cardiovascular function in cats, and development and function of skeletal muscle, the retina and the central nervous system. Although meat protein can be substituted with vegetable proteins, vegetable proteins don't require sufficient amino acids which are vital for a cats body to function.[5][6] Cats can be selective eaters. Although it is extremely rare for a cat to deliberately starve itself to the point of injury, in obese cats, the sudden loss of weight can cause a fatal condition called Feline Hepatic Lipidosis, a liver dysfunction which causes pathological loss of appetite and reinforces the starvation, which can lead to death within as little as 48 hours. Pica is a condition in which animals chew or eat unusual things such as fabric, plastic or wool. In cats, this is mostly harmless as they do not digest most of it, but can be fatal or require surgical removal if a large amount of foreign material is ingested (for example, an entire sock). It tends to occur more often in Burmese, Oriental, Siamese and breeds with these in their ancestry.</p>

        <h4>Food allergy</h4>
        <p>Food allergy is a non-seasonal disease with skin and/or gastrointestinal disorders. The main complaint is pruritus, which is usually resistant to treatment by steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The exact prevalence of food allergy in cats remains unknown. There is no breed, sex or age predilection, although some breeds are commonly affected. Before the onset of clinical signs, the animals have been fed the offending food components for at least two years, although some animals are less than a year old. In 20 to 30% of the cases, cats have concurrent allergic diseases (atopy / flea-allergic dermatitis). A reliable diagnosis can only be made with dietary elimination-challenge trials. Provocation testing is necessary for the identification of the causative food component(s). Therapy consists of avoiding the offending food component(s).[7] Cats with food allergies constantly itch their red, hairless, and scabby skin. Hair loss usually occurs on the face and/or anus. The most popular prescription diets for cats with food allergies include Hills Science Diet d/d or z/d.[citation needed] It may take, depending on the severity of the reaction, two weeks to three months for a cat to recover if the offending allergen is removed. Immediate results may not be seen.</p>
        <h4>Malnutrition</h4>
        <p>Malnutrition has been seen in cats fed home-made or vegetarian/vegan diets[citation needed] produced by owners with good intentions[citation needed], and most published recipes have been only crudely balanced (by computer) using nutrient averages.[citation needed] Because the palatability, digestibility, and safety of these recipes have not been adequately or scientifically tested, it is difficult to characterize all of these homemade diets.[citation needed] Generally, most formulations contain excessive protein and phosphorus and are deficient in calcium, vitamin E, and microminerals such as copper, zinc, and potassium.[citation needed] Also, the energy density of these diets may be unbalanced relative to the other nutrients. Commonly used meat and carbohydrate ingredients contain more phosphorus than calcium. Homemade feline diets that are not actually deficient in fat or energy usually contain a vegetable oil that cats do not find palatable; therefore, less food is eaten causing a calorie deficiency.[citation needed] Rarely are homemade diets balanced for microminerals or vitamins.[citation needed] Owner neglect is also a frequent contributing factor in malnutrition. Cats fed exclusively on raw, freshwater fish can develop a thiamine deficiency. Those fed exclusively on liver may develop vitamin A toxicity.</p>
        <h4>Obesity</h4>
        <p>Neutering and overfeeding have contributed to increased obesity in domestic cats, especially in developed countries. Obesity in cats has similar effects as in humans, and will increase the risk of heart disease, etc. thereby shortening the cat's lifespan.</p>
